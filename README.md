# `rust_sample`

This repository contains a simple Core Flight System (cFS) application,
demonstrating the use of Rust
and the [`n2o4` crate](https://github.com/BlackCAT-CubeSat/n2o4).
It aims to be a more-or-less drop-in replacement for
[NASA's sample app](https://github.com/nasa/sample_app).
Currently (August 2022), this is complete apart from table-related functionality.
